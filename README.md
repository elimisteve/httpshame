## HTTP Shame

This is a list of sites that really should use HTTPS, but don't.
Shameful!


## Why is it shameful?

Because HTTPS protects users from being spied on by anyone between
them and the website they're viewing.  Plus [Let's
Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) lets you create SSL certificates
for free, so there's little excuse!
